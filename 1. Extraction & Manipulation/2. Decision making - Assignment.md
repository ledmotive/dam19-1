## **Here Josep Carreras is providing further insides on the assigment done by Emilio Navarro**
Although the work done is correct in terms of average error rates, my opinion is that the standard deviation analyses of the data set needs to be performed in order to draw any conclusions. To my humble opinion, the steps should be as follows:
- Average error analysys
- STD is hidding MEAN values?
  1) YES: Try to filter out noise and repeat until falling into ii)
  2) NO: Draw conclusions!

If one is stuck in 1), it means that we need more statistics to discern what it's happening.

As you mentioned the reduction of errors is 0.7%, but the error of this assumption (as given by STD or any disperssion metrics or second-order moment) is between 10% and 20%, so it doesn't seem to mean anything. The team should put more effort to stand out average errors from the crowd!  


# Decision Making
## Task
* Clients complain that the searches for a destinations sometimes fail. Head of product decided to address
the issue, and ask development team to work on fix.
* The team committed to work out the solution during August. It was agreed that the team’s bonus payout
would depend on effectiveness of the solution.
* **The Head of Product ask you to analyze the data and help him to decide whether the team deserve the bonus?**

### Useful context:
* Data for Barcelona destination (18452212) is representative so that any conclusions can be extrapolated
for other destinations.

## Summary
* Yes, we are paying the bonus.  
* Assuming our bright engineerns reduce 0.70% the current error rate of 1.27%. Moving from 98.73% correct queries to 99.43% correct queries. 
* The company may be able to have additional 90 reservations per month per destination.
* **€5,396,327** incremental revenue per year including the 5000 destinations.

Below is explained the analysis to arrive to this conculsion:

### Step 1 - Data Gathering and Wrangling
* Pulled the data from the two sample files hosted on S3
* Convert the data from [JSON to CSV](http://convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm)
* Agregated the two months data into [Google Sheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YrwDs81_JLI0HSvE1W5m1pTXXnYdzl23PZS6W3He-7w/edit?usp=sharing)

### Step 2 - Average and Error Rate Calculations
* Calculate the % of successfull and error queries for the two months.

|           | Correct  | Error    | Total Queries|
|----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------------:|
| August    |  834,060 | 12,828   | 846,888
| September | 858,740  | 	8,950	 | 867,690
| Average (month)  |  846,400 | **10,889** | **846,400**
| Percentat |  98.73% | **1.27%** | **100%**


### Step 3 - Estimate Improvements
* Engineers are expecting to reduce the errors by 0.70%.

|     Description         | Value     |
|:----------------------: |:---------:|
| Reduction Errors:    |  -0.70%   |
| % Correct Queries       |   99.43%  | 
|  Correct Queries        | 852,401.02 |
| +Correct Queries        | 4,888 |


### Step 4 - Additional Revenue 
In order to decide if we pay the bonus an estimate of potential additional revenue is required.  

* Eccommerce conversion rate average 1.84% [source](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate)
* Assuming for every reservation the company makes €1.00. I made up this value, in the real world we will have an average reservation value per destination.


|     Description         |   Value.   |  Revenue
|:----------------------: |:----------:|:----------:|
| Revenue x destination | €1.00 |
| Average Conversion Rate | 1.84% |
| +Reservations/month x destination| 90 | €89.94 
| Number of Destination | 5000 | €449,694
| 1 year                |  12 months| **€5,396,327**
